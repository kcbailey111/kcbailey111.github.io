## Potential Project Overviews   

### Web Application that shows Price Disparities in Prescription Drugs 

This project aims to develop a web-based application that helps patients find the most affordable prescription medications within their local area by comparing prices across multiple pharmacies. The application will address the significant problem of prescription drug affordability and price transparency in healthcare. By aggregating real-time pricing data from a wide range of pharmacy networks, the application will empower users to make informed decisions about where to purchase their medications. Patients will be able to search for specific prescriptions, view comparative pricing, and locate nearby pharmacies offering the best deals of all from a single, user-friendly interface. The application will incorporate geolocation features to ensure that results are tailored to the users immediate vicinity, reducing travel time and increasing accessibility. It will also include filters for generic versus brand-name drugs, dosage options, and insurance compatibility, allowing users to refine their search according to personal needs. By offering clear, side-by-side comparisons, the platform will promote competition among pharmacies and encourage more transparent pricing practices. In addition to serving individual patients, the application may benefit caregivers, healthcare providers, and social workers who assist vulnerable populations in accessing affordable medications. The long-term goal is to reduce financial barriers to essential treatments, improve medication adherence, and contribute to broader public health outcomes. Ultimately, this project seeks to transform the way patients interact with the pharmaceutical marketplace by introducing a tool that prioritizes affordability, transparency, and convenience. Through thoughtful design and reliable data integration, the application will become a vital resource in the pursuit of equitable healthcare access.

### Web Application for Access to Healthcare for the Insured or Uninsured 

Healthcare access remains one of the most pressing challenges in contemporary public health, with insurance status serving as a critical determinant of care availability and quality. This proposed web-based application aims to address information gaps by providing comprehensive visualization tools that illuminate healthcare access patterns across insured and uninsured populations. The platform will aggregate and present data on provider availability, service costs, wait times, and geographic accessibility, with specialized features designed to assist uninsured individuals in navigating the complex healthcare landscape. By offering interactive maps, cost comparison tools, and resource directories, the application will serve multiple stakeholders including patients, healthcare advocates, policy makers, and researchers. The system will particularly emphasize solutions for the uninsured population, highlighting community health centers, sliding-fee scale providers, prescription assistance programs, and emergency care options. Through data-driven insights and user-friendly interfaces, this web application seeks to empower healthcare information access while exposing systemic disparities that require policy attention, ultimately contributing to more equitable healthcare delivery across all insurance categories with clarity and actionable information, while surfacing systemic disparities and contributing to conversations around equity and digital health advocacy.

###  Study of How BIPOC in the Computer Science has been affected since the Trump Adminstration

This project aims to analyze how Black, Indigenous, and people of color have been impacted in the workspace, college classroom, and overall community during the Trump Administration within the field of Computer Science. The administration has currently been cutting various programs for outreach to help allocate resources for better representation, allowing people to not be overlooked based on race or other factors. By examining shifts in funding, policy, and institutional support, the project will explore how these changes have influenced access, equity, and participation for underrepresented groups in technical fields. The analysis will focus on three primary domains: professional environments, academic institutions, and community-based initiatives. In the workspace, the project will investigate hiring trends, retention rates, and promotion opportunities for BIPOC individuals in tech companies, particularly in roles related to software development, data science, and systems engineering. Within college classrooms, the study will assess enrollment patterns, mentorship availability, and the presence of culturally responsive curricula in computer science departments. At the community level, the project will evaluate the impact of discontinued outreach programs such as coding bootcamps, STEM camps, and scholarship pipelines that previously served as entry points for marginalized youth. By compiling qualitative interviews, quantitative data, and policy reviews, the project aims to illuminate the systemic barriers that have been exacerbated or neglected during this period. It will also highlight stories of resilience and innovation among BIPOC technologists who have navigated these challenges. Ultimately, the goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how political decisions intersect with racial equity in computer science, and to propose actionable strategies for restoring and expanding inclusive pathways in the tech ecosystem.

## More Desired Project  

###  Web Application that shows Price Disparities in Prescription Drugs

### Web Application for Access to Heatlhcare for the Insured or Uninsured 

I favor these projects more because while I do know some HTML I believe this project will require an advancement of those skills while also allowing me to explore the field of data analytics, databases, and potentially cloud networking. Additionally, I enjoy healthcare topics like this to see how people's health can be made better with technology whether that is a more user friendly web application and analyze health disparities.
