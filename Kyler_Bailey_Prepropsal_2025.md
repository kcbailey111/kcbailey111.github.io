## Potential Project Overviews   

### Web Application that shows Price Disparities in Prescription Drugs 

This project aims to develop a web-based application that helps patients find the most affordable prescription medications within their local area by comparing prices across multiple pharmacies. The application will address the significant problem of prescription drug affordability and price transparency in healthcare. By aggregating real-time pricing data from a wide range of pharmacy networks, the application will empower users to make informed decisions about where to purchase their medications. Patients will be able to search for specific prescriptions, view comparative pricing, and locate nearby pharmacies offering the best deals of all from a single, user-friendly interface. The application will incorporate geolocation features to ensure that results are tailored to the users immediate vicinity, reducing travel time and increasing accessibility. It will also include filters for generic versus brand-name drugs, dosage options, and insurance compatibility, allowing users to refine their search according to personal needs. By offering clear, side-by-side comparisons, the platform will promote competition among pharmacies and encourage more transparent pricing practices. In addition to serving individual patients, the application may benefit caregivers, healthcare providers, and social workers who assist vulnerable populations in accessing affordable medications. The long-term goal is to reduce financial barriers to essential treatments, improve medication adherence, and contribute to broader public health outcomes. Ultimately, this project seeks to transform the way patients interact with the pharmaceutical marketplace by introducing a tool that prioritizes affordability, transparency, and convenience. Through thoughtful design and reliable data integration, the application will become a vital resource in the pursuit of equitable healthcare access.

### AI Application that Recommend Mental Health Tools with a Focus on Young Adults or Younger

This project aims to develop an AI application that will recommend mental health tools that are more usable for young adults and teenagers. This application will address the problem that most younger people do not necessarily know how to fully utilize the large language models currently out there to find mental health tools. By tailoring the interface and recommendation engine to the unique needs, language, and digital habits of younger users, the application will bridge the gap between powerful AI capabilities and practical mental health support. The platform will curate a selection of evidence-based resources that includes journaling prompts, mindfulness exercises, crisis support links, and cognitive behavioral strategies, while presenting them in formats that resonate with younger audiences. Through conversational AI, the application will guide users in identifying their emotional states, exploring coping mechanisms, and discovering tools that match their preferences and challenges. Rather than requiring users to know what to ask or how to phrase their concerns, the system will proactively suggest relevant options based on context, mood indicators, and usage patterns. To ensure accessibility and engagement, the application will feature an intuitive design, gamified progress tracking, and anonymity. It will also include educational modules that demystify mental health concepts and teach users how to interact with AI in meaningful ways. By lowering the barrier to entry and simplifying the discovery process, the project aims to empower young people to take ownership of their mental wellness journey. Ultimately, this application will serve as a bridge between emerging AI technologies and the everyday realities of youth mental health, fostering resilience, self-awareness, and informed support-seeking behavior.

###  Study of How BIPOC in the Computer Science has been affected since the Trump Adminstration

This project aims to analyze how Black, Indigenous, and people of color have been impacted in the workspace, college classroom, and overall community during the Trump Administration within the field of Computer Science. The administration has currently been cutting various programs for outreach to help allocate resources for better representation, allowing people to not be overlooked based on race or other factors. By examining shifts in funding, policy, and institutional support, the project will explore how these changes have influenced access, equity, and participation for underrepresented groups in technical fields. The analysis will focus on three primary domains: professional environments, academic institutions, and community-based initiatives. In the workspace, the project will investigate hiring trends, retention rates, and promotion opportunities for BIPOC individuals in tech companies, particularly in roles related to software development, data science, and systems engineering. Within college classrooms, the study will assess enrollment patterns, mentorship availability, and the presence of culturally responsive curricula in computer science departments. At the community level, the project will evaluate the impact of discontinued outreach programs such as coding bootcamps, STEM camps, and scholarship pipelines that previously served as entry points for marginalized youth. By compiling qualitative interviews, quantitative data, and policy reviews, the project aims to illuminate the systemic barriers that have been exacerbated or neglected during this period. It will also highlight stories of resilience and innovation among BIPOC technologists who have navigated these challenges. Ultimately, the goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how political decisions intersect with racial equity in computer science, and to propose actionable strategies for restoring and expanding inclusive pathways in the tech ecosystem.

## More Desired Project  

###  Web Application that shows Price Disparities in Prescription Drugs

This favor this project more because while I do know some HTML I believe this project will require an advancement of those skills while also allowing me to explore the field of data analytics, databases, and potentially cloud networking. Additionally, I enjoy healthcare topics like this to see how people's health can be made better with technology whether that is a more user friendly web application or some sort of biotech.
